# Gradient_Descent_Neural_Network
# I have simple dataframe, "bought_insurance" will be my "target" 
# I gonna create "Gradient Descent" from scratch and also "log loss" and activation function so "sigmoid numpy"
# First I import "train_test_split" and get "train" and "test" set, "X" will be "age, affordibility" and "y" "bought_insurance"
# Now I need to scale "age" in "train" and "test" set, so I make copy on both of them and "scale my age which is between 1 and 100"
# I create simple "Neuronal Network" with only one "output neuron" "input_shape", so my "age and affordibility", "activation is sigmoid" 
# Then "kernel_initializer", so my "weights" are initialize by "one" and "bias_initializer" by "zero"
